<H2 style="color:#3eff00"> How to start your coding </H2>
<P style="color:#3eff00">
If you want to start coding in HTML, then you have to put the tag &lt;HTML&gt; on the first line of your code. Then, you type &lt;Head&gt; on the next line and &lt;Title&gt; 	next to it. After that, you write &lt;/Title&gt; with &lt;/Head&gt;. Finally, you write your desired title in between the opening and closing tags.

<H2 style="color:#3eff00">How to get the main body of your text</h2>
<P style="color:#3eff00">
When you have got your header in place, you have to type &lt;Body&gt; then write the main body of text before writing- you guessed it- &lt;/Body&gt;. Once you have done that, just write what you want to write between the body tags. If you want a new paragraph, just enter &lt;P/&gt;. If you want to write out an HTML tag without its effects appearing on the document, you need an ampersand (&amp;). What you do is you have to use the special symbols&apos; (&lt; &amp &gt;) code and a semicolon (;). It looks like this-
<br/>
<br/>
&amplt;Body&ampgt; 
<br/> <br/>
for the &ltBody&gt; tag. Just follow that format for anything.

<H2 style="color:#3eff00">A new heading</h2>
<P style="color:#3eff00">
If you want to get a new heading, simply do the &lt;h1&gt; tag but don't forget to close it! If you want a subtitle, just enter &lt;H2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt; at the end of your document. <P/><P/>



<h2 style="color:#3eff00">Ending your coding</h2> <P style="color:#3eff00">
To end your coding, all you have to do is type &lt;/Body&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt;.
After this, the document is no longer reading your text as HTML and will ignore everything as it has no language to follow.<br/><br/><br/>
